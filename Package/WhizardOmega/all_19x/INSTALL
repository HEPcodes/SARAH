This directory contains model definitions for WHIZARD / O'Mega generated by the
WHIZARD - FeynRules interface. In order to use them, please copy the necessary
files to a WHIZARD 1.9x tree using the included "inject" script like

   ./inject path/to/whizard

Remember to reconfigure and recompile WHIZARD after this step.

The script provides several command line options to accommodate special cases
where the above procedure may not be enough. Please do

   ./inject -h

to see a list of all command line options. In particular, inject will not
overwrite already existing files by default. This behavior can be overridden by
using the "-f" option.
